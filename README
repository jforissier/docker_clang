This project builds Clang (LLVM) from source and publishes the result on the Docker
Hub. It was put together for the OP-TEE OS progect [1].
 
The supported targets are currently x86_64, arm64 and armhf. The compiler-rt
builtins library is included for each supported architecture, which is the reason
why this project exists in the first place. Indeed at the time of this writing the
x86_64 Ubuntu packages for Clang do *not* include libclang_rt.builtins-aarch64.a
nor libclang_rt.builtins-armhf.a, but these libraries are needed when compiling
the OP-TEE OS.

The build is done in a Docker container. The resulting image is to be used
as an archive, it only contains the Clang compilers and tools in
/root/clang-<version>.

To fetch and extract Clang from the image:

 $ id=$(docker create jforissier/clang-18.1.6-x86_64)
 $ docker cp $i:/root/clang-18.1.6 .
 $ docker rm $i
 $ docker rmi jforissier/clang-18.1.6-x86_64

Usage: 'make' builds the image, 'make push' builds it and pushes it to the
Docker Hub.
